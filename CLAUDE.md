# Benzene — agent guide

> **One drive. Every computer. All your storage.**

Context for AI coding agents working in this repo. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
are byte-identical and CI enforces that — edit one, copy it to the other.

---

## 1. What Benzene is

**Benzene is a distributed personal storage system.** A user installs an agent
on computers they already own; each contributes disk, and those combine into one
logical **Vault**. Files are placed across those devices automatically.

**S3 is optional.** It is a secondary durability tier ("Cloud Protection"), not
the primary store.

The single most common mistake in this repo is treating it as a cloud-storage
frontend. It used to be one. Plenty of code still carries assumptions from that
era. **If you find yourself writing `file == S3 object`, stop.**

Direction is defined by two documents the user maintains outside the repo:
`BENZENE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `BENZENE_PRODUCT.md`. Section references below
(§21, §81, …) point at the architecture doc. Ask for them before proposing
storage-layer work.

### Core principles

1. Files are logical entities, not storage-provider objects.
2. File versions are immutable; changing a file creates a new version.
3. Content is addressed by SHA-256 of its bytes.
4. Replicas live on independent devices — never two on one failure domain.
5. Placement, repair and rebalancing are automatic and invisible.
6. Control-plane metadata is critical infrastructure. Bytes without metadata is
   a lost filesystem.
7. Device failure is normal, not exceptional.
8. Complexity stays hidden from the user.

## 2. Repository layout

| Path | What | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `benzene-control-plane/` | Vaults, devices, files, placement, protection | Node 20, Express 5, TypeScript (strict), **PostgreSQL** via Drizzle, plus Mongo for legacy file metadata |
| `benzene-node-agent/` | Runs on a user's computer; contributes storage | Node 20, Express 5, TypeScript (strict) |
| `benzene-auth-service/` | Email/password auth, JWT issuance | Node 20, Express 5, TypeScript, PostgreSQL |
| `nebula-gateway/` | Edge: verifies JWTs, injects identity headers, routes | **Java 21**, Spring Cloud Gateway |
| `nebulavault-frontend/` | Web app | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind + DaisyUI |
| `nebulavault-user-service/` | User profiles, quota fields | Java 21, Spring Boot |
| `infrastructure/terraform/` | S3 bucket + least-privilege IAM | Terraform |
| `scripts/smoke-agent.mjs` | Cross-package end-to-end smoke test | Node |
| `YAGNI-CODE/` | Notes on removed code. Not built. | — |
| `simple-flask-server/` | Debug scratch. Not production. | — |

**Directory names still say `nebulavault-`.** The project renamed to Benzene;
renaming those touches CI path filters, imports and Dockerfiles, so it is
deliberately deferred as its own change. The GitHub repo is
`ankit013002/Benzene`.

## 3. Local development

### Ports

| Service | Port |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | 3000 |
| Gateway | 8080 |
| Auth service | 4000 |
| Control plane | 5000 |
| User service | 8082 |
| Node agent transfer server | 7070 |

### Commands

```bash
# control plane
cd benzene-control-plane
npm install && npm run dev
npm test                 # needs TEST_DATABASE_URL
npm run db:generate      # after editing src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:migrate

# node agent
cd benzene-node-agent
npm install && npm run dev

# frontend
cd nebulavault-frontend
npm install && npm run dev

# gateway — see the JDK note below
cd nebula-gateway && ./mvnw test
```

### The JDK trap

`JAVA_HOME` on the primary dev machine points at **JDK 11**, but the gateway and
user service target **Java 21**. Maven fails confusingly without this:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Eclipse Adoptium/jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### Environment

Control plane:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgres://…        # required — control-plane graph
MONGOOSE_URI=mongodb://…         # required — legacy file metadata
STORAGE_DRIVER=local|s3          # default local
TRANSFER_SIGNING_KEY=<base64 PKCS8 Ed25519>   # required for device uploads
AUTH_SECRET=<≥32 chars>
```

Node agent:

```ini
BENZENE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=http://localhost:8080
BENZENE_ALLOCATED_BYTES=53687091200
BENZENE_DATA_DIR=~/.benzene
BENZENE_ADVERTISED_URL=http://192.168.x.x:7070   # defaults to LAN address
```

Gateway and auth service both need the **same** `AUTH_SECRET`, ≥32 chars. Both
fail fast without it — deliberately, since a weak shared key silently
undermines every downstream identity claim.

## 4. Architecture

### Control plane vs data plane

The separation is fundamental.

- **Control plane** answers *who, what and where*: identity, vault membership,
  which devices are online, which devices hold which object, whether protection
  is satisfied. It stores metadata and **never carries file bytes**.
- **Data plane** moves bytes: browser ↔ device, device ↔ device. Direct
  transfers, never relayed through the control plane if avoidable.

If you find yourself streaming file content through the control plane, you have
almost certainly taken a wrong turn.

### Domain model

```
User → Vault → Device → StorageAllocation
            → Replica (object hash ↔ device)
            → StoragePolicy
```

Files belong to a **vault**, not a user — so household/family vaults later need
no reshaping.

Chunking, manifests and file versions exist in the architecture doc but are
**not implemented yet**. Whole-file placement first, deliberately (§107).

### The upload path

```
1. Browser hashes the file (SHA-256)
2. POST /placement/upload-targets   → control plane decides + reserves + signs grants
3. Browser PUTs bytes straight to each device
4. POST /placement/confirm          → replica promoted to healthy
```

Bytes never pass through Next.js, the gateway or the control plane.

---

## 5. Security model

Three distinct authentication mechanisms. Do not confuse them.

| Who | How | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User → gateway** | HS256 JWT in an `httpOnly` cookie | `nebula-gateway` |
| **Device → control plane** | Ed25519 signature per request | `/agent/**` |
| **Browser/peer → device** | Ed25519 transfer grant | agent transfer server |

### Identity headers

The gateway verifies the JWT and injects `X-User-Id` / `X-User-AuthSub` /
`X-User-Email`, **stripping any client-supplied `X-User-*` first**. Downstream
services trust those headers because only the gateway can set them — which is
why the control plane must never be publicly exposed.

`requireUser` refuses a request with no `X-User-Id` rather than defaulting to an
unowned tenant.

### Device request signatures

A device signs `METHOD\npath\ntimestamp\nsha256(body)`. Covering all four means
a captured signature cannot be replayed onto another endpoint or with altered
content.

### Transfer grants

Scoped to **one object, one device, one operation, ~5 minutes** (§81). The
expected object and operation come from the *route*, never from the grant, so a
grant for one object cannot be replayed to reach another and a read grant cannot
authorise a write. The signature is verified **before** the payload is parsed.

Deliberately not a JWT — a fixed format has no `alg` field to negotiate down.

### The `/agent` prefix

Agent endpoints live under `/agent/**` and the gateway routes that prefix
**without** its session filter: a machine mid-enrollment holds no session.
User-facing device management lives under `/devices/**` **with** the filter.

**Never merge these prefixes.** Overlapping paths would force the gateway to
carve exceptions, and one mistake either locks devices out of enrollment or
exposes a user endpoint with no session check.

---

## 6. Cross-package contracts

The control plane and node agent are **separate deployables** that each hold
their own copy of two wire formats. If they drift, authentication breaks in a
way *neither package's own tests would catch* — each still passes against
itself.

Two byte-identical vector files pin them:

| Contract | Control plane | Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request signing | `src/modules/devices/protocolVectors.ts` | `src/protocolVectors.ts` |
| Transfer grants | `src/modules/placement/grantVectors.ts` | `src/grantVectors.ts` |

Both packages assert against them, **and CI diffs the files.** Ed25519 signing
is deterministic, so the vectors pin an exact signature, not merely a valid one.

**Never edit one copy alone.** Changing a wire format means regenerating the
vectors and updating both files in the same commit.

---

## 7. Testing

**Tests run against real infrastructure, not fakes.**

- Control-plane tests use a **real PostgreSQL**, one throwaway database per test
  file. The behaviour under test lives largely *in* the database — partial
  unique indexes, `for update` locking, aggregate filters — and a fake that
  disagrees with Postgres is worse than no test. Per-file databases because
  Vitest runs files in parallel and a shared one has each file truncating
  another's fixtures mid-run.
- `scripts/smoke-agent.mjs` runs the **real agent against the real control
  plane** over HTTP: enrollment, approval, signed heartbeat, upload to device,
  download back, and unauthorised attempts refused. Needs both packages built
  and a reachable Postgres.

```bash
# control plane
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres npm test

# end to end
node scripts/smoke-agent.mjs
```

Current counts: control plane **245**, agent **75**, auth **71**, gateway **10**,
smoke **29 checks**.

### Testing conventions

- Test names state the behaviour, not the method: *"refuses to shrink below what
  the device already stores"*, not *"setAllocation works"*.
- Comment the *why* on tests encoding a non-obvious decision.
- When fixing a bug, assert the **persisted state**, not just the thrown error.
  A real bug here — expiry recorded inside a transaction that then threw, rolling
  back the very update — was only caught because a test checked the row.

---

## 8. Working conventions

### Verification

**Do not report work as done without running it.** Typecheck, test, and build.
Where the change is visible, open it in a browser and look.

Two things caught only by looking, both after the code "passed":

- The login page still said **Nebula Vault** after the rebrand — the wordmark
  was split across two elements, so grep matched neither.
- The marketing hero renders invisible until Framer Motion animates it in. In a
  hidden browser pane rAF is throttled, so it never appears. Preview artifact,
  not a product bug — but worth knowing before chasing it.

### Git

- Trunk-based, short-lived branches, PR into `master`.
- Prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `test/`.
- `master` requires 1 approving review. A solo maintainer cannot satisfy that
  and merges are done with `--admin`, which **bypasses the rule**. Say so when
  you do it.
- Commit messages explain *why*, not what. State the problem, then the fix.

### Code style

- **Strict TypeScript.** No `any`, no non-null assertions to silence the checker.
- Comments explain **why**, never what. Do not narrate the code.
- Validate at the edges with zod; keep the interior typed.
- Prefer pure functions for decisions (see `placement.ts`) so they are testable
  without infrastructure.
- Match the surrounding file's idiom.

### Honesty

State limits plainly in code comments, PR bodies and summaries. If something is
unverified, say it is unverified. The Terraform README says "validated, not
applied" because no `plan` has ever run against an account — that phrasing is
the standard to match.

---

## 9. Current state

### Works

- Self-contained email/password auth; gateway JWT verification and header
  injection
- Vaults, device enrollment (pairing code, user-approved), presence/heartbeat,
  storage allocation
- Placement engine with protection policies (1/2/3 copies) and health reporting
- Node agent: identity, content-addressed store, allocation ceiling, integrity
  verification, LAN transfer server
- **Uploads route to devices end to end**, with downloads reading back
- Devices screen and vault summary in the web app
- Terraform for the S3 bucket (validated, never applied)

### Not built

- **Repair engine** — a degraded object stays degraded. This is the most
  important gap: without it, protection decays permanently on first device
  failure. `listUnderProtectedObjects` is its queue.
- **Rebalancing**, device draining (status exists; nothing moves data)
- **Chunking and manifests** — whole-file placement only
- **Encryption at rest** — objects are stored as plaintext. The object format
  records `v` and `encryption: "none"` so encrypted objects can coexist later
  without a migration, but the key hierarchy and recovery story (§33) are
  undesigned. **Design this before real user data lands.**
- **Remote access / NAT traversal / relay** — LAN only
- Desktop and mobile apps, filesystem mount, sharing, search, billing
- File metadata still in MongoDB, not yet migrated to Postgres

### Known limits worth repeating

- **Browser-to-device only works over http.** An https-hosted app cannot PUT to
  `http://192.168.x.x` — mixed content. Fine locally; production needs local
  certs or the relay path (§39).
- **The browser hashes whole files in memory.** `crypto.subtle` needs the full
  buffer; large files need the streaming hash chunking would bring.
- **The agent's private key is a `0600` file**, not Keychain/DPAPI/Keystore
  (§34).

### Open product questions — do not silently resolve these

1. **Availability.** The headline promise (travel, tap a file, it plays) needs a
   home device awake and reachable. Consumer desktops sleep. Cloud Protection
   covers the gap but costs money, which turns "cloud is optional" into "cloud is
   required for the headline feature".
2. **Replication factor 1.** "Maximum Capacity" is offered as a plain menu
   choice; one dead drive loses those files permanently. The engine flags
   `singleCopy` and the UI warns, but whether it should exist at all is unsettled.
3. **Key recovery.** Unsolved, and not retrofittable once devices hold real data.

If a feature depends on one of these, surface the assumption rather than picking.

## 10. Design language

Benzene is **monochrome** — near-black ink on paper in light, inverted in dark.

**Colour is spent only on state.** A coloured dot means a vault at risk, a
device draining, an error. Never decoration. Status colours are desaturated so
they read as information against greyscale.

Everything is token-driven in `nebulavault-frontend/src/app/globals.css`. Do not
hardcode hexes or Tailwind colour utilities (`blue-500`, `emerald-400`) —
components that did were permanently dark and ignored the theme. Use
`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-success`, and so on.

Consumer language, never internal jargon: *Vault*, *Device*, *Protected*,
*Restoring protection*, *Being removed*. Never *replication factor*, *manifest*,
*chunk*, *NAT traversal*.
