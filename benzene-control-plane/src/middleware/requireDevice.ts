/**
 * Authenticates a node agent by Ed25519 request signature.
 *
 * Unlike the user path, this does not go through the gateway's JWT: a device is
 * not a person and holds no session. It proves identity per request by signing
 * method, path, timestamp and body hash, so a captured signature cannot be
 * replayed against a different endpoint or with altered content.
 *
 * The timestamp window bounds replay of an identical request. Closing that gap
 * completely needs a nonce store, which is worth adding before devices are
 * reachable from the public internet.
